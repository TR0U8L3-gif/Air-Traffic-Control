# Air Traffic Control
This repository is our second project for the object-oriented programming at the Bialystok University of Technology
## quick code overview: 
 We have a radar that displays a map with non-moving objects, and we can place various types of aircraft on the radar (planes, helicopters, balloons) 
 Each aircraft has its own route (composed of sections with constant flight parameters: altitude, direction or speed)

### Instructions: 
 The program should periodically check and signal dangerous approaches and collisions between ships
 Also, the Program should enable modification of aircraft flight routes
 
### Minimum scope of functionality:
 
loading and displaying maps together with objects

random generation of aircraft and their routes

aircraft traffic simulation

issuing re-routing commands

detection and signaling of dangerous close-ups and collisions between objects
